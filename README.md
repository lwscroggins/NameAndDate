Express API
==============

Create an express API that has a route that will display the local time, a route that takes a first name as part of the url and greets that name. For instance if the call specifies a name of 'Zaphod' it should send a JSON object that looks like this: {"msg" : "Hello Zaphod!‚Äù}
